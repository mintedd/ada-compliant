# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Took provided base code and inspected and refactored for semantic errors in HTML. By doing so, the code was more organized, easier to read, and more convenient to build CSS off of. The final product was a much shorter code for both HTML and CSS. While inspecting the code, learned how important it is to pay attention to what tags are being used in specific places and how that plays a role in its function.

# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor 
This weeks homework assignment. 
* Take existing code and refactor an existing site to make it more web accessible friendly. 
* Added tabindex to toggle between different parts of the website with just the tab key on the keyboard.
* Added color to the footer to make it easier to see where it begins and ends.
* Visually not much change but organized CSS to make more sense with the HTML.
* Made sure that the semantics of HTML made sense
